This website presents the grammar of New Ithkuil, a design for a constructed human-usable language. The language uses a matrix of grammatical concepts intended to express deeper levels of human cognition more overtly, logically, and precisely than natural languages. The language is based upon a predecessor, [Ithkuil](http://ithkuil.net/00_intro.html), but has been significantly modified to incorporate various suggestions for improvements from fans of the predecessor language (see [Appendix C](15#C) for a list of these contributors) as well as new ideas from its author. New Ithkuil is far more systematic and regularized in its structure compared to its predecessor, making it potentially easier to study and learn.
