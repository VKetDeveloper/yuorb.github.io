Fundamental Principles of Singing and Phonetics
* Every musical note possesses its temporal span.
* Typically, a single note is assigned to each syllable.
* Syllabic structure can be concisely delineated as `(ω)ρ` wherein `ρ = ν[κ]`.
* `ω` = onset; `ρ` = rhyme; `ν` = nucleus; `κ` = coda.
* A nucleus is predominantly vocalic, whereas a onset and a coda are primarily consonantal.
* A rhyme governs the note's pitch.
* A nucleus occupies the predominant portion of the note's duration.
* A coda occupies a segment of the note's duration.
* Considering the syllabic structure `(ω)ρ`, the `ω` component does not consume a note's duration but is articulated preceding the note's commencement.
* An exception: if an onset ends in an voiced approximant or liquid, the approximant or liquid can occupy a portion of the note's duration.
* In sequences of consecutive notes, an onset of the subsequent note may encroach upon the duration of the preceding note or be considered a part of its syllable's coda.
* Should the coda encompass multiple phonemes, the duration allocated to each phoneme diminishes proportionally.

## Comparative Analysis of Syllabic Structures:

* Japanese: `(C[j/w])V[N/Q]` wherein `κ` = `[N/Q]`; however, `N` and `Q` are usually moraic and occupies the predominant portion of the note's duration; `Q` may be realized as `V` it follows if moraic.
* Chinese: `(C[M])V[C]` wherein `κ` = `[C]`
* English: `(CCC)V[CCCC]` e.g. *strengths* wherein `κ` = `[CCCC]`
* New Ithkuil:
  * If there is a syllable whose onset and coda both have a shared `ν`, the longest possible form would be `(CCCCC)V[ʔCCCCC]`, e.g. *aňzzgralkstra*, wherein `κ` = `[ʔCCCCC]`
  * A coda can maximally comprise six to seven consonantal segments: `V[ʔCCCCC]` or `[ʔCCCCCC]` e.g. ***a'ňzzgr**amar**a'lksstr**a*
The challenge of singing in Ithkuil lies in the necessity to accurately and consistently articulate each segment of the consonant cluster within a very short time. The duration of the syllable nucleus is also shortened due to such reasons.
